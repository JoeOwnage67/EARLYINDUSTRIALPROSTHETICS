**DESCRIPTION**

EARLY INDUSTRIAL PROSTHETICS PATCH for MEDIEVAL PROSTHETICS

This is a patch for Nuno's mod, "Medieval Prosthetics", applying rebalancing to work amounts, materials, etc to align with my "Medieval Medicines - Medieval Overhaul Edition" values, with the fantasy elements removed, and DOES NOT require Medieval Overhaul. 
  
All credit for the original mods and art assets goes to Nuno. 

All credit for original rebalancing/reworking research projects and work ticks in Chirurgie Patch goes to Awan.

This patch is meant to use Nuno's medieval prosthetics and change them to suit an early industrial / wild west theme, with no fantasy elements. Prosthetics recipes are stuffable where possible so you can choose which materials to use (Metallic, Woody, etc).
